# NeuralNetworks

This challenge gave us the opportunity to evaluate information from 34,299 contributions that were made to approximately 20,000 organizations. We evaluated information of the company regarding the type of business, requests for funding and size of the organization. We also looked at previous information on the success of the resource allocation. We discovered that the resources were adequately used 53% of the time. Our goal was to increase this usage and obtain a success rate of 75% or greater. <br />

We cleaned, organized and preprocessed the data. Using TensorFlow Neural Networks with Keras layers, I added two hidden nodes and activated ReLu. I also did a Linear node and SVM model. To compile the Neural Network model, I used the Mean Absolute Error loss and Adam optimizer. After fitting the model and running 100 epochs, I obtained an accuracy of 73%. I saved some code to run additional models by changing some of the variables. Due to the size of the dataset, I did not run additional code, as the process was extensive and in excess or 3 hours in total. <br />

Overall, the success of providing resources to the listed business improved as we utilized the proper modeling and process to make decisions.
